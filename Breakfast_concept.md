## About the history of breakfast<br>
While early humans likely ate food in the morning, the English term “breakfast” originated in the 15th century and refers to the breaking of the nightly fast--the first meal of the day. This meal has often consisted of a combination of eggs, grains, and preserved meat (bacon, sausage), dairy (yogurt, cheese), and fruit (jams). 

Due to poverty, a scarcity of food, working conditions and/or cultural norms, most people throughout history only ate one to two main meals per day.  These meals often featured the same food and were served in the early to mid-afternoon.  Much of medieval Europe even thought it was unhealthy to eat in the morning and associated breakfast with hedonistic and/or lowly lifestyles.

Breakfast did not become a standard meal until the 19th century Industrial Revolution.  In Europe and North America, with the rise of regimented factory work schedules and daily routines, mealtimes became more clearly delineated and breakfast both grew in importance and size. These heavy breakfasts led to many complaints of indigestion and health problems, and now it is more common to eat a light meal before work.

## About breakfast’s effect on health<br>
Breakfast has been called the most important meal of the day, but few scientists would go that far. That said, current research does suggest that regularly eating a healthy breakfast can improve your general health, memory, and academic ability.  The same has also been said for lunch and dinner. 

## Breakfast vs. brunch<br>
Brunch is a meal served roughly from 10am to 2:00pm. While one can eat a light meal at brunch, you may also likely find heartier and more laborious breakfast foods along with lunch items on a brunch menu.  In the United States, these may include a combination of omelets, eggs benedict, pancakes, waffles, potatoes, fried chicken, bacon & sausages.  While alcohol is rarely served during breakfast, it is often available during Brunch.
